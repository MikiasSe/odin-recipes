    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make corned beef and cabbage</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place corned beef in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add spice packet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corned beef is just about fork-tender, about 2 hours. While the corned beef is simmering, cut potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 3-inch pieces. Cut cabbage into small wedges.</li>
        <li>When corned beef has cooked for 2 hours, add potatoes and carrots; cook until vegetables are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage and continue to cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 more minutes.</li>
